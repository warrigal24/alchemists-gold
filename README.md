# Alchemist's Gold

By Garry Francis

## Background

Of all the forms of alchemy practised throughout the ages, the best known is the quest to turn base metals into gold. Of course, everyone knows this is impossible. Even so, there's a rumour that an alchemist in the forest has figured out how to do the impossible and has been building up quite a stash of gold.

After picking up a lead in the local tavern, you think you have worked out the location of the alchemist's house. After trudging through the forest for a day, you stop to get your bearings and have a rest. You feel like you're getting close.

This is a traditional text adventure that was written for [ParserComp 2022](https://itch.io/jam/parsercomp-2022), 30 April to 30 June 2022.
